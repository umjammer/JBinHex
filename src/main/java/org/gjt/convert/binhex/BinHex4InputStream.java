/**
 This class completely decodes a BinHex4 file in three parts: the header,
 the data fork and the resource fork.
 By default, all the InputStream-derived methods work on the data fork. With
 the methods <code>useDataFork</code> and <code>useResourceFork</code> the caller
 can select from which fork this stream will read. However, because this stream
 obtains the BinHex4 file through a stream, one can only read the forks in the
 order that they are in the BinHex4 file, which is: first the data fork, then 
 the resource fork. A future version of this class that obtains it's data from
 a RandomAccessFile may be able to switch to reading from data and resource
 fork at any time.

 <p>
 Lacks something that translates between Unicode and the Mac character
 set to deal with foreign characters in filenames, types and creators.
 Anyone who has such a thing under a GPL license is invited to send it to me.
